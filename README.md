# PiEye
Thesis project for Ragnar Einestam and Karl Casserfelt.
A novel apperance-based eye contact detection sensor, developed for small hardware.
The sensor uses LDA for feature reduction and SVM for binary predictions.
The accuracy reached using 10-fold cross validation is .85 MCC (Matthews Correlation Coefficient).
The range and speed of the system are negatively correlated.
